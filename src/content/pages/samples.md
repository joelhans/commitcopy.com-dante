  description: Take a peek at copy, marketing content, and advising projects I've completed with past clients.

Curious about the copy and marketing content I’ve written for other clients?

## Copywriting for Rewind

I help Rewind’s demand generation and content teams with display ads and landing pages targeting DevOps and IT leadership who must protect the modern (aka SaaS-based) software development lifecycle.

- **LinkedIn ads for GitHub users**
  - ["A `git clone` ≠ a full backup of your mission critical code."](/samples/rewind_github-1.png) <span class="text-sm">`.png`</span>
  - ["Weekly reminders to push to a secondary `remote` are not a foolproof solution."](/samples/rewind_github-2.png) <span class="text-sm">`.png`</span>
  - ["GitHub can't back up your account-level data."](samples/rewind_github-3.png) <span class="text-sm">`.png`</span>
  - ["Backign up your GitHub-based code with `git bundle` is far from comprehensive."](/samples/rewind_github-4.png) <span class="text-sm">`.png`</span>
- [**Landing page for DevOps/IT leaders**](/samples/rewind_for-development.png) <span class="text-sm">`.png`</span>

## Technical leadership essays for ngrok

I use ngrok’s flexible networking technology to build bridges across the open-source ecosystem and tell complex stories about development and engineering.

- [**Build an API in Next.js and deploy with Rancher**](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/next-js-kubernetes-rancher)
- [**AI meets privacy: ngrok's secure bridge to customer data**](https://ngrok.com/blog-post/ai-meets-ngrok-privacy-customer-data)

## Messaging framework for Devtron

I join the co-founders of this open-core startup to align the messaging around the Kubernetes software delivery platform, giving their audiences of DevOps and platform engineers fresh reasons to commit.
