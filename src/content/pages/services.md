I specialize in copy and marketing content for product marketing managers, DevRels, and content leads who need to reach technical audiences and the open-source community.

## Copywriting

My copy for product marketing and demand generation campaigns educates your technical audiences, respects their experience, and inspires them to commit to what you’ve built. Every technical product has a story—I specialize in bringing them from LOCs to life.

## Technical leadership essays

Showcase your experts' strongest opinions and the technical prowess of your engineering team. Drive conversation (or controversy!), clone your brand values with far more reach, and demonstrate to prospects you know your stuff inside-out.

## Messaging workshops `&&` frameworks

Drive your organization to merge around key value props, ideal customer profiles, and targeted messages for precise and consistent communications anywhere your peers get a spotlight&mdash;sales calls, Series A pitches, conference booths, speaking gigs, and far beyond.

## Advising

Let’s develop your next technical content strategy. Facilitate a workshop between engineering and marketing to button-up where you `diff` on content. Organize a big-ticket product launch. Chart a clear path into open source and community management. Let's go after your toughest goals&mdash; you need to bring is your team's ambition.
