> the past few weeks has completely transformed Simply Stated's content strategy.
>
> Joel took the time to thoroughly research my company, our products and the space we operate in even before our first
> meeting. He then went far beyond the scope of our agreement to proactively suggest some deeply-researched topic areas
> for content big rocks and worked extensively with our team to create truly fantastic and inspiring articles that are
> perfectly tailored to our audience.
>
> I have yet to meet anyone else who is able to combine Joel's purpose-driven writing with his substantial technical
> expertise.
